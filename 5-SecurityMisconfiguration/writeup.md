## Steps Needed to Fix

- Add authentication using the [Authorize] attribute
- Implement authorization check to ensure users can only access their own data

- Use HTTPS for all sensitive data transmissions

## Process and Tools to Prevent in My Project

- Implement security code reviews
- Use static code analysis tools like Security Code Scan
- Regularly update and patch all components and frameworks
- Implement proper error handling and logging practices
- Use configuration management tools to ensure consistent secure settings across environments
