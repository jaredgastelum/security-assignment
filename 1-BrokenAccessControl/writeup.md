## Real World Example

- In November 2024, the Helldown ransomware group exploited CVE-2024-42057, a command injection vulnerability in Zyxel firewalls' IPSec VPN, to breach 31 organizations' networks5

## Steps Need to Fix

- Implement proper authorization checks:
  - Use the [Authorize] attribute to ensure only authenticated users can access the endpoint.
  - Implement a custom authorization policy to verify that the requesting user has the right to access the requested user's details.
- Modify the endpoint to include authorization logic:
- Implement the custom authorization policy
- Register the authorization policy in the Startup.cs file

## Process and Tools to Prevent in My Project

- Implement the principle of least privilege throughout the application architecture.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) consistently across the application.
- Use security static analysis tools (SAST) like SonarQube or Veracode to detect potential access control issues in the code.
- Conduct regular security code reviews focusing on access control mechanisms.
- Implement proper logging and monitoring of access control failures to detect potential attacks.
- Utilize API gateways or middleware to centralize and enforce access control policies.
- Regularly conduct penetration testing to identify and address access control weaknesses.
- Use security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent unauthorized access to resources.
